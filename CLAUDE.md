# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, Three.js, and FFmpeg WASM. The project showcases interactive 3D graphics, image processing, video conversion, and stock data visualization capabilities.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server (runs on port 3000 with special headers for FFmpeg)
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Run ESLint
yarn lint

# Preview production build
yarn preview
```

## Project Architecture

### Core Technologies Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei
- **State Management**: @tanstack/react-query for server state, custom hooks for local state
- **Styling**: styled-components with custom theme system
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg WASM for client-side video conversion
- **Data Visualization**: @nivo/line for charts
- **Routing**: react-router-dom with page transitions

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Three.js Integration

- **CanvasCore Component** (`src/components/molecule/canvasCore/CanvasCore.tsx`): Reusable wrapper for all Three.js scenes with standardized camera controls, lighting, and loading states
- **ModelCore** (`src/components/organism/three/modelCore/ModelCore.tsx`): Core Three.js model handling logic used across all 3D components
- **Custom Materials**: BannerMaterial, ImageMaterial, and BentPlaneGeometry in `src/utils/materials/`

#### Animation System

- **Animation Core** (`src/styles/theme.ts` line 65): Centralized animation functions using styled-components for consistent transitions
- **Fade Transitions**: Page-level transitions using react-transition-group

#### API and Data Management

- **React Query Integration**: Used for stock API calls with parallel requests and error handling
- **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Hooks in `src/hooks/` for specific features (useImage, useGetDetail, etc.)

#### Image Processing

- **Async Processing**: CPU-intensive color correction operations use setTimeout(300ms) to maintain UI responsiveness
- **Canvas API**: Direct canvas manipulation for Instagram-style filters

#### Video Processing

- **FFmpeg WASM**: Client-side video conversion to MP4 format
- **Cross-Origin Headers**: Special Vite configuration required for SharedArrayBuffer support

### Development Notes

#### Vite Configuration

- **Port 3000**: Development server with custom headers for FFmpeg support
- **SVG Support**: @svgr/rollup for SVG component imports
- **Chunk Splitting**: Manual vendor chunking for optimal bundle size

#### Font Strategy

- **CSS Import Method**: Prevents font flashing during load
- **Dynamic Font Loading**: Prepared for English/Korean language switching

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Three.js Model Loading**: Sequential loading strategy (main model first, then smaller models)
- **Image Caching**: Public directory assets for browser caching
- **Bundle Optimization**: Vendor chunk splitting in Vite config

#### ESLint Configuration

- Standard TypeScript + React rules
- Relaxed rules for @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment and no-explicit-any (warnings only)
- React refresh plugin for development

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Always run linting before committing:

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Special Considerations

1. **FFmpeg WASM Requirements**: The development server requires specific CORS headers for SharedArrayBuffer support
2. **Three.js Performance**: Models use Draco compression and sequential loading to optimize GPU usage
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: All pages implement responsive design with styled-components breakpoints
4. **Public Assets**: Images should be placed in `public/` directory for optimal caching

### Core Reusable Components

- **CheckCondition** (`src/lib/util/CheckCondition.tsx`): Conditional rendering utility
- **ShowError** (`src/components/molecule/showError/ShowError.tsx`): Error handling component for API failures
- **CameraMouse/CameraLookAt**: Three.js camera control components in molecule/canvasCore/

This architecture emphasizes reusability, performance optimization, and clean separation of concerns for 3D graphics, media processing, and data visualization features.
